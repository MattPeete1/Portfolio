# Matthew Peete's Software Engineering Portfolio

Having built a strong foundation in customer service, management, and problem-solving from my previous career, I'm now diving into the technical realm. I've developed a good understanding of both the software side and the business side of things, which helps me figure out what clients might want and need. My past experiences have helped me ensure everything works well daily. Now, I'm excited about facing challenges related to complex computer systems and am particularly interested in exploring issues around modern technologies like automation.
